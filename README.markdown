# Bringing RAD back (to CodeIgniter)

Bonfire's goal is to provide powerful development tools on top of a stable, consistent and elegant framework that make developing your app as simple, quick and, dare we say it, fun as possible.

Bonfire is not a CMS. Instead, it provides tools that enhance the standard CodeIgniter 2.0 code base to speed up your development process. All wrapped up in one sexy little package. 

Besides the powerful of CodeIgniter 2.0, Bonfire will provide at least following: 

- Standard Libraries for: 
  - Templating
  - High-performance Asset Management
  - User Authentication/Authorization
  - Caching
- GUI Tools for: 
  - Code Generation
  - Building jQuery-enhanced forms
  - Database Building/Management
  
...and plenty more as time goes along.
